# About
**Algorithm** is a window application with which you can **visually** observe :monocle_face: how the basic sorting algorithms work, with the ability to **customize** the array. 
Also, the user can stop the algorithm at any time and use the arrows to look at the operation of the algorithm **step by step**.
This app was written as a first year university coursework with degree in Computer Science.
